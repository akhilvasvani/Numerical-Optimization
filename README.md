# Numerical-Optimization
Numerical Optimization for Machine Learning

This repository contains the intuition behind basic numerical optimization using multivariate calculus and vector operations. More importantly, it contains python example code for numerical optimization.

# Line Search

Line search is quickly glossed over in study guide, but I put in some example code to help better illustrate how to use it. However, sometimes instead of trying to write code it might just be easier to use the current libraries such as scipy: (https://github.com/scipy/scipy/tree/master/scipy/optimize) for optimization purposes. 

I put in the folder first order and second order algorithms for just using Line Search.

# Hill Search

Included a package called mlrose, which was the the libraries for several algorithms including Hill Climbing. Very useful to use. Also included is a tutorial on how to use them.

# Enjoy

Please let me know if any of my explanations are not clear or need improvement. I am happy to correct and edit.
